# midori's nixos configuration repository

hello! this is my nixos config. you can replicate it in your system by installing nixos on your machine, generating a new `hardware-configuration.nix` file for your machine, adding it to `system/hosts`, and then running the `bin/update` script for the new configuration to take effect.

# TO DO:

- [ ] add dunst
- [ ] move neovim config completely into nix (nixvim)
- [ ] move picom config completely into nix
